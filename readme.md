# What I am currently Working on:

## Soft body finalisation

* [ ] Allow organelle to trigger unlinking of membrane segments
* [ ] Allow organelle to grab and hold vertex segments

With the above 2 features implemented I should be able to get organelle mediated
endocytosis (which ultimately means the brain can control eating).
